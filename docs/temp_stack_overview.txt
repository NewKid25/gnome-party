How does the current stack works
- right now we are deploying a whole stack (WebSocketAPI, Lambdas, and DynamoDB)
- run `dotnet lambda deploy-serverless TempSockStack -sb temp-sock-buck` to deploy the code and create the services
- run `wscat -c wss://nl4g15d5v5.execute-api.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Prod` to connect to web socket (assumeing you have installed wscat via npm and that link is the correct link for the websocket api)
- logs for lambda functions are stored at CloudWatch>Logs>Log management on the AWS web console
- to change the name of the table created without chnaging code raise the "-tp/--template-parameters" flag
	- e.g.: dotnet lambda deploy-serverless SocketService -sb gp-backend-bucket1 -tp ConnectionMappingTableName=TestName
